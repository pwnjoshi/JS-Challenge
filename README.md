## About

This repo is aimed at beginners and intermediate developers who want to practice JavaScript fundamentals through small, focused examples. Each file demonstrates a single idea or language feature with commented explanations.

## Highlights

- Clear, focused examples (one concept per file)
- Lightweight: no external dependencies required
- Good for self-study, workshops, or pairing sessions

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository

	```bash
	git clone https://github.com/pwnjoshi/JS-Challenge.git
	cd JS-Challenge
	```

2. Open the folder in your editor (VS Code recommended).
3. Run examples with Node.js (recommended v14+):

	```bash
	node 01_basics/05_strings.js
	```

Note: These are plain JavaScript files â€” no build step required.

Read comments inside files for explanations and suggested modifications to try.

## Development

This repository intentionally avoids extra tooling so learners can focus on language features. If you'd like to add automated checks or a linter, consider adding:

- a `package.json`
- an ESLint configuration
- GitHub Actions for CI

## Testing

No automated tests are included by default. To add tests, initialize a `package.json` and add a test runner (e.g., Jest) and create a `tests/` folder.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome. If you want to add examples or improve explanations:

1. Fork the repository
2. Create a branch for your change
3. Make clear, focused commits (one concept per file)
4. Open a pull request describing the change

Please keep examples small and well-commented.
